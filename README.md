# web-mobile-project

This is the term project of mobile web developmentï¼Œit's a backend of the run app.

We use flask as our backend framework.

In the whole backend project, there are five main parts: `user, acitvity, admin, tips, run`, which of them has their own function.

**User** part is mainly used to deal with the operation about user such as `login`,`register`.

**Activity** part is mainly used to query the information of activities.

**Tips** part is used to give user some random but useful tips, which may help user have a nice running experience.

**Run** part is used to deal with the  function of user starting running and ending running, recording some  basic information about the running.

**Admin** part is designed to conveniently  manage all datas in the database. However due to the tight schedule, we  have no more time to finish this part. We make it better when we are  available.
